Build tools are software utilities essential for automating the process of
compiling and packaging code for use.

The four central aspects of a build tool are:
1. Build Environment Setup
2. Task Management
3. Automation
4. Dependency Management
5. Code Optimization

## CMake
 CMake is a build tool widely used for the C/C++ Languages, but can be used to 
 build code from other languages as well.

## Make

`make` is a utility that automatically determines which targets need to be 

## Ninja
 Ninja is a build system which focuses on speed and is primarily designed to be 
 used by higher-level build systems like CMake. Per ninja-build.org, "It takes 
 as input the interdependencies of files (typically source code and output 
 executables) and orchestrates building them, quickly".

 It has been designed for speed, adaptability and ease of use. 

 Ninja looks for a file named build.ninja in the working directory and builds
 all out-of-date targets.
